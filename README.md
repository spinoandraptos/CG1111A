Attached above is the Arduino code used to program a MBot to navigate a maze using an ultrasonic sensor, an infrared sensor, and a self-made colour sensor. The ultrasonic sensor and infrared sensor are used for distance sensing, which helps the MBot to determine its didsdstance from walls on its 2 sides and make necessary adjustments. The self-made colour sensor is built using a light-dependent resistor and 3 LEDs (red, green, blue). Through measuring the amount of red, green and blue light reflected off an object (which is translated to a voltage level across the light dependent resistor), the colour of the object can be approximated accurately. The Mbot will perform a specific action like making a right turn depending on the colour of an object it detects. With optimisation to the colour sensing mechanism through heavy callibration, my team built the fastest MBot of the lab, completing the entire maze in 34 seconds without any collision with walls.
